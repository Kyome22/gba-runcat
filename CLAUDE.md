# Claude Code Configuration

## You Must

- Please respond in Japanese.

## You Must Not

- You must not read @Sources/RunCat/Cat+TileData.swift and @Sources/RunCat/Road+TileData.swift. The reason is that the file is huge and would consume too many tokens. The content consists of image data converted into a UInt32 array.

## Coding Rules

- Do not write comments within the source code.
- Use naming conventions that clearly indicate the purpose of the code, even without comments.
- In Swift code
  - Abbreviations such as URL or ID should be written in all lowercase or all uppercase (do not use Upper Camel Case for these prefixes).
  - Do not use abbreviations such as `img` for `image` or `cnt` for `count`.
